# atsf4g-co
service framework for game server using libatbus, libatapp, libcopp and etc.

# Inner Service
+ [atproxy](atframework/service/atproxy) : proxy for logic server to communicate with each other
  * using [etcd][1] for service discovery and online detection.

+ [atgateway](atframework/service/atgateway) : gateway for client to communicate logic server
  * Using DH/ECDH for key establishment(directly send key or no encryption are also supported)
  * Traffic control and handshake timeout available for each client
  * Support for routing switching

# Dependency
1. [libuv](http://libuv.org/)  -- libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O.
2. [msgpack-c](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c)  -- [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) is an efficient binary serialization format, and [msgpack-c](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c) is a c and c++ driver for it.
3. [libiniloader](https://github.com/owt5008137/libiniloader) -- a small and lightweight ini loader code.
4. [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) -- libcurl is a free and easy-to-use client-side URL transfer library
5. [libcopp](https://github.com/owt5008137/libcopp) -- Cross-platform coroutine library written in c++.
6. [rapidjson](https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson) -- A fast and header only json library.
7. [flatbuffer](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers) -- A simple pack/unpack library. It's used in atgateway's inner protocol.


# Prepare
1. Install [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd). (It's used for atproxy to connect to each other.)
2. *[opional]* Install [redis](http://redis.io/). (DB services.install it if used)


# Extern Dependency
1. libuuid-devel(uuid-dev)
2. *[opional]* hiredis, redis (if using redis, full_sample branch has use redis)

# Basic Usage

## Build on Windows
You need to prebuilt all dependency libraries such as openssl/mbedtls, libcurl, libuv and so on.
Then run
```bash
mkdir build_jobs_msvc
cd build_jobs_msvc
# run cmake
cmake [SOURCE PATH] -G "Visual Studio ... Win64" -DLIBUV_ROOT=[LIBUV INSTALL PATH] -DOPENSSL_ROOT=[OPENSSL INSTALL PATH] -DPROJECT_ENABLE_UNITTEST=YES -DPROJECT_ENABLE_SAMPLE=YES -DPROJECT_ENABLE_TOOLS=YES ...

cd build_jobs_msvc

cmake --build . --config Debug
```  
Please see [3rd_party](3rd_party) to see which libraries is required.

## Build on Unix like system
```bash
# auto setup cmake

sh cmake_dev.sh [options] ...

# we will generate directory build_jobs_$(basename $(uname -s)) for build and place publish directory
cd build_jobs_*

# just build with make -j4 or ninja -j4
cmake --build . -- -j4
```
Such as sh cmake_dev.sh -su to enable all unit test and samples, or sh cmake_dev.sh -a to use clang-analysis.
You can also directly run cmake [SOURCE PATH] [options...] just like in windows, use your own prebuilt libraries or not.
It depends to you.

All resource and file will be put into ```<BUILD_DIR>/publish``` after compile completed.

## Configure & Run
Configure file is placed on ```<BUILD_DIR>/publish/tools/script/config.conf``` just edit it and set your **etcd server** and ***DB configure***， then run ```<BUILD_DIR>/publish/tools/script/gen_conf.py``` to generate all configure files and scripts for servers. ```restart_all.sh``` 、 ```stop_all.sh``` 、 ```reload_all.sh``` script files will also be generated for easy usage.

```bash
cd publish/tools/script

vim config.conf # edit configure

python3 gen_conf.py

./restart_all.sh
```

```gen_conf.py``` also has options for set some configures instead of using it in config.conf, it's useful when integration our server into other management system. Use ```python3 ./gen_conf.py - --help``` for more help information.
